My parents are converts to the church and we were able to be sealed in the temple when I was younger. That was such a special experience and I can't wait to be sealed to Porter and start our eternal family. I have been in choirs my whole life and love all things music. I am a dancer and have danced for over half of my life. I did ballroom for many years and now continue to do Mexican traditional folklore dancing. I'm currently at UVU studying Exercise Science with dreams of becoming a Physical Therapist. I can't wait for what life will bring for Porter and I! </p></div>

In high school, I wrestled and played football, but the outdoors has been a lifelong love. If I could, I'd probably camp, fish, or hunt everyday (something Kris is gonna have to get used toðŸ˜‰). Rifles, racks, and deer tracks-that's what boys are made of! Currently I'm a student at BYU studying in the Marriot School of Business and excited to start my next chapter in life with Kristelle!</p></div>

Kristelle went home in November of 2022 and we kept contact on Preparation days while I was still a missionary (still a professional relationship at this point of course). As we talked every week, it became more and more apparent to me that Kristelle was someone I wanted to try and date.
                            <br> -Porter
                        <br>
                        Soon after Porter got home from his mission, he came to visit me in Utah and it became very clear there was going to be a wonderful future for us. After a few months of long distance dating he moved to Utah for school and we continued our relationship, now in person. Every day became more and more clear eternity with Porter is what I wanted. And lucky for me, he felt the same. I don't know when he will propose but I hope it's soonðŸ˜‰.
